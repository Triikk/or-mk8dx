# Getting started
This is a tool for finding good builds in Mario Kart 7/8/8 Deluxe.

# How to run
```console
minizinc mk_builder.mzn mk8_data.dzn
```
for a simple run (add `--all-solutions` if you want more solutions, `--solver <solver>` for whatever solver you want (`minizinc --solvers` for a list of available solvers)).
